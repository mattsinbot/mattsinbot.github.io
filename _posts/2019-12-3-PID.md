In this page, I will post results that I found while designing a PID controller for a single-input-single-out (SISO) dynamic system. Basically the objective of this experiment was to implementing an analog circuit to communicate a turntable and controlling its speed through a digitally implemented PID controller. The interface between the digital controller and analog circuit is made through a **data acquisition system** (DAQ) from *Texas Instruments*. You can see the setup of the experiment below.

The circuit diagram of the above physical circuit is as below.
