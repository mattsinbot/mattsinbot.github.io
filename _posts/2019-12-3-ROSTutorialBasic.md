In this post, I am going to share some youtube videos which I created in Summer 2018 to teach basics of ROS to a group of undergraduate students at Stony Brook University.

1. A tutorial on spawning a robot in Gazebo and visualize in RViz can be found here [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxr6z8eIfrI).

2. A tutorial showing service-client paradigm to find a path can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0LOSBSYn04).

3. Once a path is available, the tutorial that implements a pure-pursuit controller to follow that path can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b348R-G8wO0).

4. A tutorial on creating a map of the environment using *gmapping*, *move_base* and *teleop_keyboar_twist* nodes can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlabLPpXDPQ).

5. Having an existed map, how to upload that map in ROS for moving around the environment can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtId8BEfrCs).
