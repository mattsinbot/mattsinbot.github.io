In this post I will show some theoretical analysis of the PID controller that we have designed in my previous post. After going through this post one will be able to under stand how to derived transfer function of a PID controller, what are the different characteristics of step input response and how are they defined. Finally we will use the data that we have collected in previous postduring the experiment to simulate a PID controller and analyze its step response.

# Transfer function of a PID controller
A PID controller block, takes the error signal as input and generates control output signal. In time domain if we define control input as $$u(t)$$ and error signal as $$e(t)$$, then based on the definition of PID controller, we write

$$u(t) = K_Pe(t) + K_I\int e(t) + K_D \dot(e(t))$$

Taking the Laplace transform we get,

$$U(s) = (K_P + K_I/s + K_Ds)E(s)$$

Therefore transfer function of the PID block is obtained as,

$$T(s) = \frac{U(s)}{E(s)} = K_P + K_I/s + K_Ds$$


After running the above script in python, we can visualize the data as in the figure below.
