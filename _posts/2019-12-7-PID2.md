In this post I will show some theoretical analysis of the PID controller that we have designed in my previous post. After going through this post one will be able to under stand how to derived transfer function of a PID controller, what are the different characteristics of step input response and how are they defined. Finally we will use the data that we have collected in previous postduring the experiment to simulate a PID controller and analyze its step response.

# Transfer function of a PID controller



After running the above script in python, we can visualize the data as in the figure below.
