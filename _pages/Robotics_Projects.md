In the above figure (generated by running `main_one_file.py`), the actual location of the car is visualized as the green circle where as the distribution of the posteriors are shown in blue particles and prior beliefs are shown in red particles. Notice that initially, we were completely uncertain about the actual location of the car and that is why particles are distributed everywhere in the world. However, after a few iterations most of the particles were clustered around the actual location of the car with a small error covariance.

The particle filter implementation here has the following key steps,
1. Initialize a number of particles in the environment by uniformly sampling (uniform random sampling) the range of X and Y coordinates. At this time we have no information of the actual location of the car since we have no sensed data.

2. In order to simulate the actual behavior of the car, we create a `fake_robot` object which moves around the environment and sends sensed data.

3. Next for each move that the fake robot makes and gives new measurement of the environment, we perform a two stage manipulation on each particle. Firstly, we move each particle with equal amount and let them have their own measurement of the environment. Secondly, based on how close the measurement of each particle matches with the actual cars measurement we assign importance weight to each particle. Finally carry out resampling of the particles such that particles with higher weights have many copies and lower weights has less number of copies.

There are many resampling strategies out there, however here we have followed the one explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNQVo6uOgYA).

Below we make a comparison of the advantage of using Particle Filter over Extended Kalman Filter.
* Particle filter can capture arbitrary distribution of the prior and the posterior. But EKF can only represent these distributions as Gaussian distribution.
* In EKF, nonlinearity in observer and measurement model is approximated as linear models. Unlike EKF, the Particle Filter does not need the linearization of the nonlinear observer and measurement models.
* Particle Filter is easy to understand and implement. EKF requires to understand involved mathematical treatment.
* However particle filter provides a discrete distribution of  the prior and posterior. But EKF provides continuous distribution of those distributions.
* In terms of computational complexity, particle filter is worse than EKF.
* Overall particle filter has gained more popularity because of its simplicity of implementation and its power to capture multimodal distribution of the prior and posterior with no need of linearization (computing the Jacobians) of the nonlinear observer and measurement models.
