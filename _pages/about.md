Hi! i am Anirban Sinha. I am a fifth year PhD student working in robotics. My expected graduation is in May 2020.

**Research:** My research revolves around endowing robots with AI capabilities that ensures self-evaluation of robotic tasks and developing robust algorithms for the same while considering actuation and sensing uncertainties. One branch of my research is path planning of redundant manipulators under task constrained situations.

**Current Project:** Currently, I am working on a project in collaboration with graduate students who are specialized in computer vision. In that project we are trying to  predict trajectory of a sliding object by learning from the data collected from a vision system.

**Mentoring Experience:** I have mentored 3 MS students toward completing their thesis.

**Internship:** In summer 2018, I worked as a software development intern in Auris Health. My work was related to writing C++ Python wrapper to expose C++ functionalities in Python side. My contribution to their code base has been successfully tested on Monarch platform which is the main product of Ausris Health.

**Other:** I am also a machine learning enthusiast. I credited the Machine learning course from the department of computer science. In the course project, I have completed several ML+CV related projects. I am also equipped with Data-Structures and Algorithms. I took the Data-Structures & Algorithms course in Udacity and successfully graduated.

**Coding Skills:** C++, Python, MATLAB, Robot Operating System (ROS).

**Goal:** My short term goal is to have a comprehesive idea about the problems and state-of-the-art solution techniques, that are in use in autonomous driving industry with hands on experience. My long term goal is to generate new ideas, built on top of the current techniques and make them work in practice and revolutionize the field.
